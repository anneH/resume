    <h5>
    I just started the online coding bootcamp at <a href="https://kickstartcoding.com/">Kickstart Coding</a>.   
    I'm already creating this responsive portfolio website with Bootstrap!  What I like best about the course so far are lessons that keep my interest and give me consistent hands-on practice.  I also really like the flexibility of the online option.  I can learn from home after work on a schedule that works for me.
